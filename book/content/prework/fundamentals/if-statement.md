# If Statements

How do you make a sandwich? Is it exactly the same process for every single sandwich? Of course not, if it were every sandwich would be exactly the same! Obviously we have choices and decisions to make. Think of all the different choices we had in the last section. Each one of those options changed the kind of sandwich we made. As we discussed, using variables can help make that process more universal: we can tell the computer to just grab **bread** and **meat**. But what about more complicated decisions? Like whether or not the person wants mayonnaise? Or tomatoes? Maybe we could write a different set of instructions for each one of those choices. But if we had to create a brand new sandwich making program for each combination of options, it will not be long before it becomes unsustainable! (`sandwich with mayo`, `sandwich with tomatoes`, `sandwhich with mayo and tomatoes`, `sandwich with mustard`, `sandwich with mayo and mustard`, etc.) Instead what we want is a way for our program to make decisions for us. We want the computer to be able to ask "does the person want **pickles**? *Yes*. Ok, go ahead and put them on." What we need is called an "if statement".

An if statement is how we give the computer a choice. We tell the computer, if the answer to some question is *yes* (or *true* or *1*) then follow these instructions. Suddenly, rather than creating a completely separate program for each combination of options, we can make one set of instructions that makes choices for us!

> `if` the person **wants mayo** `then` spread it on the bread

> `if` the person **wants lettuce** `then` add some

> `if` the person **wants bacon** `then` give them a high five!

In essence, we are giving the computer the ability to skip over part of our instructions. If the answer to our first question is *no* then skip it, and the same for the second, third, etc. These pieces of the program are now optional for the computer. Sometimes though our questions are more complicated. Perhaps we want something to happen if the answer is *no*? Or maybe we are not asking a yes or no question but comparing some values? We could even write some instructions for if a value is *yes* and different set if it is *no*.

> `if` the person does `not` **eat meat** `then` make a grilled cheese

> `if` there are `less than` *2* **strips of bacon** left `then` go cook some more

> `if` the person **likes dijon** `then` use Grey Poupon `otherwise` use French's

The concept of an if statement is seemingly simple, but there is a lot of power built into it. Remember the first example, of the stylish yet affordable furniture instructions. It had no choices to it; we simply read those instructions from top to bottom without making any decisions. Now though, we are creating instructions that do a variety of things just by asking a simple question: if some value is yes, then follow these steps. In class we will teach you the syntax for creating an if statement, and you will learn how to combine these questions together into a variety of complex steps and decisions. It all depends on what are the questions you want the computer to ask.

# Getting Started

Before moving forward, let's talk about how best to use this Prework material.

## Prerequisites

This section is intended to familiarize you with high level software development concepts. It will cover vocabulary, navigating a computer through the command line, and many broad ideas in web programming. It is a good idea to read through this material but also bookmarks parts of it that may be useful in later sections or in class.

## HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Git

These chapters will begin with a video that walks you through the curriculum and explains some concepts and processes that may not be obvious from simply reading the text. Take the time to watch these videos; they contain material that may not be easily conveyed in just the text.

These lessons will all end with an exercise for you to complete. When working on these we will be storing our files in a folder called `Codeup` on your computer's desktop. To create this folder, hide your other applications and switch to the Finder. Make sure you have no other windows open and press <kbd>&#8984;Command - &#8679;Shift - N</kbd>. Name the folder `Codeup`. (You can also accomplish this from the commandline by running `mkdir ~/Desktop/Codeup`).

Once you have created this folder, testing your work is done by dragging files from the `Codeup` folder into Google Chrome. To learn how this is done, please refer to the first video lesson on [HTML](https://vimeo.com/155164430/000fb3ae5b).

# Creating a Repository

GitHub allows you to have public repositories for free, meaning you can store any code you are willing to share with the world without upgrading to a paid plan.

We will be storing our work in public repositories, making it easy for instructors and peers to view the code, comment on it, and fork it. When we begin to work in groups, we will rely on git and GitHub to work efficiently in the same codebase.

## Exercises

{% if book.curriculumName == "prep1" or book.curriculumName == "prep2" %}

1. Login to [GitHub](https://github.com) using the same credentials you use at Codeup.

1. Click the Plus (`+`) button at the top right to make a [new repository](https://github.com/new).

1. Name this new repo `Codeup-Web-Exercises` with a description that makes sense to you.

1. Make sure repo is set to `PUBLIC`.

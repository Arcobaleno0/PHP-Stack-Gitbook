# What's Next?

Now that you have graduated from Codeup, it is time to put your skills to work! This section includes example projects we at Codeup have come up with, as well as some real challenges other students have been given in interviews.

Most of these projects are intended to be done individually, although some have a scope large enough for teams of two or three to accomplish. Some projects will have recommended resources for you to use, most will require you to use your "google-fu" to find information to help.

This is not step-by-step curriculum, like our previous material. Client and employers are not going to give you an outline of how to accomplish your tasks, just a goal state to work towards. This section will generally do the same.

Good luck! And remember, the most important thing to do after leaving Codeup:

***Just keep coding!***

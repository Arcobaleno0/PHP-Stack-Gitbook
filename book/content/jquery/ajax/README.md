# Ajax request

> Ajax is a group of interrelated Web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. Data can be retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object. Despite the name, the use of XML is not required (JSON is often used in the AJAJ variant), and the requests do not need to be asynchronous.

Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Ajax was originally intended to work with XML coming back from the server, but this does not mean you *must* serve up XML for the requests. JSON notation has been widely adopted for sending and retrieving data for Ajax requests.

# Using Files

In this section, we will be discussing how to use PHP to both read and write to files within our filesystem. This gives us tremendous power to manage files, log critical information, and keep track of incoming and outgoing data within our applications.

Fortunately, PHP gives us several ways to read the contents of a file, edit what is in a file, delete files, and manage files. There is an entire [section of functions dedicated to the filesystem](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.filesystem.php).

## Seeing form input values

Add the following code to the top of your exercises. Comment this code out as necessary so that it does not interfere with the layout of your site. This PHP code is there in order for you to see the results of submitting your forms.

```php
<?php
  var_dump($_GET);
  var_dump($_POST);
?>
```

## Exercises:

1. Create `contact.php`, a "Contact Me" page with a contact form including from, subject, and a message body. Later in the course, you will configure this form to email you. Style this page so that it matches your existing personal pages.
1. Create `register.php`, a registration page for registering visitors as new users. Ensure that your styling and presentation of this page matches the design of your existing work.
1. Create yourself a `login.php` page featuring a form that has inputs for username and password.

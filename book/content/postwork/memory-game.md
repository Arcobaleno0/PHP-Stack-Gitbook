# Memory Card Game

> Concentration, also known as Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn.

The objective of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards until all cards are matched.

## Your game should:

1. Display a set of cards, all face down initially.
1. Allow the user to click on one card, and then another. When each card is clicked it should flip over and show its image or value.
1. Compare those two cards to one another and see if they match. If they match, keep the cards face up. Otherwise, flip the cards back over.
1. Keep track of how long each round lasts, and upon successful completion of the game, allow the user to input their name for "High Score" tracking.
1. The game should display the high score page each time a round is completed. These scores should persist across sessions, but could have an option to reset all scores.

## Additional Features:

* Allow the user to specify how many cards for the round (an even number).
* Allow the user to choose a time limit for each round.
* Allow multiple users, switching between users for each turn/attempt.
* Keep score, incrementing that score by a particular amount when a matching pair is found - and decrementing score when a failed attempt is made. Include that score when the round is completed, allowing it to be placed on the high score page.
* Add sound effects on card click, successful match, round won and round lost. Special effect for new high score, including graphics, would be pretty sweet.

# Codeup Curriculum

This repository is the collection of the entire Codeup curriculum. Files are written in Markdown, organized into individual topics, and broken down into ordered units where necessary. This repository is not meant to be used independently. Instead, it is designed to be used a submodule of our various Gitbook repositories. The Gitbooks organized which portions of the curriculum will be used and how they will be sorted and organized in the class. Please use one of those parent repositories rather than working directly with this one.

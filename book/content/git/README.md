[Git Introduction](https://vimeo.com/155253926/a2ea053103)

Wikipedia describes Git as:

> Git (/É¡it/) is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.

We will use Git to store our code and all the revisions we make.

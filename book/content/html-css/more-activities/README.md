# Putting Everything Together

In the next section, you will be adding significant work to both your personal site and a longer term Codeup project called Ad-Lister, which is like an Amazon/eBay/Craigslist clone. This is an opportunity for you to showcase your HTML layout and CSS presentation skills in projects that you'll use and host in production later. We will be revisiting both these projects through the entire course. This is the time to set your design, get the layout and presentation correct, and as provide as much content as possible.

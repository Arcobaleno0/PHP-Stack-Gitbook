# Beef Up Your Blog

**Is your blog better than mine?**

Can you:

1. Tag posts?
1. Create unique slugs for your posts?
1. Log in using a third party OAuth provider?
1. Display a gallery of images?
1. Do an infinite scroll of recent posts on the homepage?
1. Maintain a persistent block of contact info affixed on the side of the page?
1. Allow people to contact you through a form via eMail?
1. Include captcha for user registration/login?
1. Create an RSS feed of your posts?
1. Perform sweet JavaScript transitions/effects to visually wow your prospective employer?

What *else* can you make it do?

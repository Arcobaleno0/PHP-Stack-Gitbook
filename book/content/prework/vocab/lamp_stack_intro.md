# LAMP Stack Intro

## L is for Linux

As you already know, Linux is an operating system. In our LAMP+J class, we will be using Macs with OSX, which is a UNIX based operating system comparable to Linux. We will be using a version of Linux as a virtual machine to host our websites as we develop them locally. If that does not make sense to you now, do not worry; it will make sense once the class begins.

## A is for Apache

Apache is one of the most widely used web servers available. We will use Apache to serve up our web applications.

## M is for MySQL

MySQL is a very popular open source database platform. A database allows you to store information that can later be retrieved and reused.

## P is for PHP

PHP is a scripting language that will allow us to create dynamic websites. PHP is in use by approximately [80% of the servers on the web](http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php/all/all).

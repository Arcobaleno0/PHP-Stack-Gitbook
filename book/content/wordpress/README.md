WordPress was released on May 27, 2003 as a blogging platform. Since then, it has evolved more and more into a content management system (CMS) for websites. Even though it is being widely used as a CMS, WordPress still stays true to its blogging roots and comes with the home page pointing to the blog section by default after the install. But any of this can be changed easily as you will see in the coming lessons.

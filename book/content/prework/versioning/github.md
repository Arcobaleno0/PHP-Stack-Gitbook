# GitHub

As you start to write code, you will also begin to see a need to backup and save different versions of your files for the off chance that your local copy should become corrupt. This is where Github comes in. Git is what we call a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). GitHub acts as the server that has a copy of your git repository (a repository is what we call a project being tracked by git). See the diagram below for an idea how git works in a team environment:

This makes it easy to have a local version and an online backup of your code. There are actually many advantages of having your code on GitHub, including:

1. Local and online backup
2. Easy to share your code with others
3. Easy to add collaborators that can contribute to your project (repository)
4. It can serve as an online portfolio for potential employers

As a student of the LAMP+J class, you will need your own GitHub account. All your work done in the course will be "checked-in" to git repositories and pushed out to your account.

First, you will need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). When creating your account, you may choose any username you would like, but please try to use a username you would be comfortable with other professionals seeing. Your GitHub account will act as a portfolio for you after you leave Codeup.

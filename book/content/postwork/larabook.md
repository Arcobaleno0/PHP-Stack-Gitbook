# LaraBook

Create a Facebook clone in Laravel. It should have the following features:

1. **User Profiles** - (including new user registration) with a featured image/avatar.
1. **Image Galleries** - to allow users to show off their photos.
1. **Friends** - Users should be able to *friend* each other, and display a list of their friends.
    - Friends of your friends should be able to see your friend list, but others should not.
1. **Groups** - Users should be able to join groups, create pages which display information on their group&mdash;including a Google Map with their location&mdash;and allow only other registered users to join the group.
1. **User Homepages** - should display their info, along with their friends, groups, and a few recent images.
1. **Status Updates** - users should be able to post new statuses.
1. **Comments** - users should be able to comment on their friends statuses.
1. **eMail Updates** - users should be able to toggle eMail notifications for events; like new friend requests, comments on their statuses, etc.

The scope of this project makes it ideal for working in a team. Furthermore, this may be a good chance to experiment with, and learn about, [Laravel 5.0](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0).

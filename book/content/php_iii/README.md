# PHP III

You now know HTML and some basic PHP. It is time to begin integrating PHP with HTML to create dynamic websites. Before getting into the details there is an important term for you to know. That term is MVC, and it stand for Model-View-Controller. Although you may not get all the details just yet, having this concept in the back of your mind during the coming lessons will be important to prevent you from picking up bad coding habits.

## What is MVC?

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. MVC is a software pattern that separates data, programming logic, and presentation into separate parts to allow for a more organized and more easily maintained codebase.

- Models represent the data layer of the application.
- Views represent the presentation layer of the application.
- Controllers provide the glue that link the Models and Views together.

You will hear all this again later. In this chapter, we will be working only with Views and Controllers. For now, the only thing you need to remember is that keeping your View (HTML) separated from your Controller/Programming Logic (PHP Code) is very important for creating organized and maintainable code.

With that, let us begin exploring PHP with HTML...

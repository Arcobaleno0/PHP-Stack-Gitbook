# Coding Challenges

This section will contain some basic challenges, all of which are intended to require only you, yourself, and Google to complete.

It may be rewarding to use these challenges as a way to compete with your fellow students. Come up with your own solutions and then compare code clarity, conciseness, performance (where applicable) and even who came up with the solution fastest.

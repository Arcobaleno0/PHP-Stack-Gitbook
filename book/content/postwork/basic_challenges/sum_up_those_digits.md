# Sum Up Those Digits

Create a function that will:

1. Accept any number as input.
1. Validate that input and convert it to an integer as necessary.
1. Return the sum of the individual digits of that integer.

For example:

    Input:  12345
    Output: 15

You may do this as a command line application, a web page with PHP, or an interactive page using JavaScript.

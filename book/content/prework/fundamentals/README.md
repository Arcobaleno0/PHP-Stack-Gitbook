# Fundamentals

Before we jump straight into the complexity of learning the full Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (or LAMP) stack, let's learn a little bit about the core concepts of what these technologies actually are and what they do.

## What the Heck is a Program Anyway?

Imagine you bought a bookshelf from a certain Swedish furniture company. When you bring it home, your bookshelf is broken apart in half dozen boxes scattered across your living room and you are holding a small booklet of instructions telling you how to put it together. A program (or "script") is like that booklet, but for your computer. It is a set of step by step instructions your computer follows to do some task. In Codeup, we will learn how to write these instructions.

When those clever Swedes write their instructions, they use some common words and symbols to describe the process of building things. They might have one symbol that represents a hammer. They would have a different one for a screw. Each of the shelves would have a letter on it so you can quickly identify which one is which. All of these symbols and icons together make up a syntax. The Swedes use that syntax to write the instructions for building our bookshelf. By combining those symbols and icons together differently, they could write instructions for building a desk, or a coffee table, maybe even a trendy and minimalist car!

A programming language works the same way. A programming language gives us a set of words and symbols, and we can combine those together to tell the computer to do virtually anything we want. In Codeup, you will learn about these key words and symbols. You will learn how to combine these pieces together to write a variety of different programs that do dozens of different things.

Before we get into that however&mdash;before we learn all the ins and outs of the exact syntax for writing a program&mdash;there are some common concepts and tasks we want to learn. In the next few pages, we will learn about these high level concepts, and how they work in general, without being bogged down in the nitty gritty of the actual syntax.

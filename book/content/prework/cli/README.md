# Introduction to the Command-Line Interface

In this section we explore the command-line interface (CLI), and specifically the Bourne-Again Shell (BASH). A command-line interface is a text-based interface, as opposed to a graphical user interface (GUI) which you are likely familiar with. This means that all your interaction with the interface is done by typing in commands and reading the text output.

This section will cover:

- An overview of what a CLI is and how to interact with it
- The layout of unix based filesystems
- Managing files using some common commands

# jQuery Selectors

jQuery makes selecting elements in the DOM very simple and has a powerful and optimized selector engine.

We will be concentrating on the [basic selectors](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/basic-css-selectors/):
- ID Selector `#id` &mdash; Selects a single element with the given id attribute.
- Class Selector `.class` &mdash; Selects all elements with the given class.
- Element Selector `element` &mdash; Selects all elements with the given tag name.
- Multiple Selector `selector1, selector2, selectorN` &mdash; Selects the combined results of all the specified selectors.
- All Selector `*` &mdash; Selects all elements.

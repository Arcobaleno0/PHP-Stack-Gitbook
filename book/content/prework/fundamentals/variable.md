# Variables

Imagine you are making sandwiches for a group of people. There are actually a lot of choices that go into making just one. What kind of bread do they want (`wheat`)? What kind of meat (`turkey`)? Do they want tomatoes on it (`yes`)? How about onions (`no`)? How many slices of cheese (`3`)? How many pieces of bacon (`ALL OF THE BACON`)? Each of these choices go into the process of making a sandwich; each one changes what kind of sandwich you are making and how you assemble it; and each one can and will change for a different person and sandwich. If we were writing a sandwich building program, each one of these options would be what is called a "variable."

A variable is a way of storing and holding onto some value. That value can be some text (`sour dough` bread please), a number (we only have `20` pieces of bacon), a yes or no value (do you want mustard? `no`), or even a combination of values (here is your sandwich: `roast beef` on `rye` with `no` lettuce and `20` pieces of bacon). When we write a program, we need some way of creating variables and assigning a value to them. In essence, our instructions for the computer need to be able to say:

> the **bread** `is` *pumpernickel*

> the **meat** `is` *salami*

> the **person wants pickles?** `is` *yes*

> the **number of tomatoes** `is` *3*

In these examples, we can say that the name of the variable is in **bold** while the variable's value is *italicized*. This distinction between the name and the value may not make sense at first, but it is an important one to start thinking about. For example, what if somebody changes their mind?

> **bread** `is` *multigrain*

Our variable name did not change&mdash;it is still **bread**&mdash;but the value DID: it is now *multigrain*. By using a variable for **bread** our sandwich can change, but the instructions for it will not.

> grab `2` slices of **bread**

Variables are an important concept for programming. In Codeup, you will learn how to declare variables and assign values to them (the **bacon** is *delicious*), how to modify them (we have *0* **strips of bacon** left), and how to retrieve their value from the computer (how many **pieces of bacon** did Ben eat? *50*, get him to a hospital.)

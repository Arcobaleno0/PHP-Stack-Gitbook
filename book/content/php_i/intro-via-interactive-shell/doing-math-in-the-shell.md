## Math in Shell

Computers are good at math; that's no surprise. PHP knows arithmetic so well, it'd make a grade-school math teacher blush.

The PHP docs have a great section on [arithmetic operators](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.arithmetic.php), and it is worth the read.

We'll be diving deeper into PHP operators soon; however, some quick math fun never hurt anyone.

Starting simple, adding numbers can be done with the `+` operator.

	php > echo 1 + 1;
	2
	
Subtraction is just as easy, using the `-` operator

	php > echo 1 - 1;
	0
	
Negative numbers as results are prepended with a minus sign `-`

	php > echo 5 - 10;
	-5

Creating negative numbers works the same way

	php > echo -5 + 3;
	-2

Division uses the `/` operator

	php > echo 10 / 2;
	5
	
Multiplication use the `*` operator (SHIFT-8)

	php > echo 2 * 5;
	10
	
### Calculate the answers

Using the interactive shell, find the solution to the following problems:

	455 * 875
	398125 - 43125
	355000 + 645000
	1000000 / 25

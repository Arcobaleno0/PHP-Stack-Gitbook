# Ajax Based Dashboard

1. Fork and/or download the [Codeup Queue Simulator](https://github.com/gocodeup/queue-simulator) and set it up on your server.
1. Create a JavaScript application that will run the simulation by making ajax requests to `ajax.php` once every second.
1. Use [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com), [D3](http://d3js.org), [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org) or another charting library of your choice to visualize the live simulation data. At a minimum, we should be able to see the current maximum wait time and the average wait time at a glance, along with historical data for both. Whatever additional metrics you would like to visualize are up to you.

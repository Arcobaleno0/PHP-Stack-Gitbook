# Intro to Virtualization

Virtualization, as defined by Wikipedia is:

> the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including but not limited to a virtual computer hardware platform, operating system (OS), storage device, or computer network resources.

Virtualization is used to create software processes that provide the same functionality as entire hardware systems, specific hardware equipment, and also other software such as operating systems.

To virtualize something means to simulate its use by running it as a software process. The digital processing of hardware like RAM and network cards or operating systems that run on hardware (such as Linux, Windows, and OS X) can be virtualized because their operations can be simulated solely by other software.

"Virtual Memory" is a common type of virtualization, and users encounter it regularly. This is a feature of Windows (and other operating systems) where the operating system (OS) virtualizes  additional amounts of computer memory by using storage resources on the hard drive. Another type of virtualization is called emulation. With emulation, the virtual machine simulates the complete hardware architecture in software. If you have ever seen a Nintendo or arcade game run on a PC, then you have seen emulation in action. Another type of virtualization is full virtualization, and full virtualization completely simulates a machine's hardware and all its software processes and runs its OS on the host machine.

## Benefits of Virtualization
Hardware systems like processors and networking equipment are commonly virtualized to save resources and achieve objectives with software rather than more expensive hardware components. We can also virtualize entire servers and operating systems in order to run them as separate, isolated software processes on a host machine.

Because software is cheaper to copy than hardware is to manufacture, virtualization is a valuable practice used in large IT departments, individual computers, game machines, and also software development. Additionally, virutualization simulates the physical infrastructure necessary to provide on-demand architecture necessary for cloud computing, which we commonly see as in the form of software as a service (SaaS), platforms as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service.

Further benefits of virtualization include the ability to:

- deploy and provision identical workstations or servers, which is valuable in many business situations.
- program how and when virtual resources are used or made available
- dramatically lower the cost, infrastructure requirements, and heat generation compared to running the actual physical machines.

Ad-Lister is a project meant to be an e-commerce application like Amazon/eBay/Zappos/Craigslist with a smaller set of features. This project is something that we'll be working through the course.

## Exercises:

In the following exercises, we will be creating pages with structure, layout, and content necessary for you to

1. Create a welcome page for Ad-Lister called `adlister.welcome.php`. This page is a marketing home page or welcome page. Take inspiration from the welcome pages for Amazon/eBay/Zappos and similar e-commerce type sites.
1. Create a registration page with registration form for new users called `adlister.register.php`.
1. Create a login page for Ad-Lister called `adlister.login.php`.
1. Create a page for creating new advertisement listings. This should be called `ads.create.php` and should have all the form inputs necessary for when users will create new advertisements and item listings.
1. Create a page called `ads.index.php`. This page will serve as a way for visitors to see all advertisements or advertisements with a specific category.
1. Create a page called `ads.show.php`. This is a product advertisement detail page. It should show all the details on a single ad.
1. Create a "contact seller" `contact.php` page with a contact form containing a from, subject, and message body.

Take time to make this content compelling and unique.

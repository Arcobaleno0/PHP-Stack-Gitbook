# Structured Query Language (SQL)

RDBMS applications use a programming language called Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is pronounced "sequel" or like "ess-queue-ell", and is the language that system administrators and developers use to interact with their RDBMS. The SQL language allow us to create, manipulate, backup, and delete entire databases, tables, users, user permissions, and also specify relationships between related data.

In addition to managing the database and its structure, SQL is the language we use to:

- build queries, which means to ask questions about the data in the DB.
- create new records
- read, update, and delete existing records

# Basic Statements

So far we have learned the basic SQL commands to create users, databases, and tables. At this point we are going to shift gears and start learning the queries for working with data. Although these are SQL queries just like what we have learned already, it can be helpful to think of them as being in two separate categories. You have one set of commands to create and manage the *structure* of your database, and another set to manipulate the *data* in your database.

These queries are often called [*CRUD*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations, meaning "Create, Read, Update, and Destroy". CRUD is the basic building block for working with data in any system, whether it is a database, a web API, a cache server, etc. By and large, most of the SQL you write in the future will be CRUD commands.

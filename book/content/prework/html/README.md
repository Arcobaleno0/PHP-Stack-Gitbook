# HTML

HTML along with CSS are the building blocks of web pages. Right click on this page and select "View Page Source" or "Show Page Source". You will see the code that built and laid that page out, all written in HTML.

HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language". Every page you see online is built with HTML. There may be other technologies running behind the scenes on a server, but the final output will always be HTML, since that is what your web browser understands. With HTML we will layout the structure of how our webpages will be organized what their content will be.

## HTML 5

HTML5 is a set of changes and improvements made to the original HTML language that made it more flexible and clearer. Some features HTML5 added include:

1. It is easier for developer to know what tag goes where
1. It helps for search engines to index your page
1. It helps people with disabilities and use screens readers to help them go through your website

Below is a simple sample of HTML syntax:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Title of page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
                tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,
                quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
                consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse
                cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non
                proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

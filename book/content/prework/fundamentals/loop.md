# Loops

Let's talk about numbers. Suppose the sandwich we are making right now needs *5* pickles on it. "Great," you may think, "I put 5 pickles on it." But I ask you, is that really what you do? Do you really put *5* pickles on that sandwich all at once, or do you put *1* pickle on it *5* times? Congratulations, you have just done something in a loop!

A loop is anything that is done in a repeated manner. We take a set of our instructions and tell the computer to do them over and over again until it is finished. Many times this has to do with some number that we are counting up to. The pickles above are a perfect example of this.

> `continue` putting pickles on `until` there are *5* pieces

> `continue` grabbing bread `until` there are *2* slices

> `continue` adding bacon `until` there are *50* strips

When reading our program, the computer follows our instructions step by step, and at the end of each step it checks the count of whatever item we are tracking. "Grab a slice of bread. How many pieces do I have? One. Grab a slice of bread. How many pieces do I have? Two. Ok, go to the next instruction."

We can also use a loop for something other than counting. Consider the following examples:

> `continue` toasting the bread `until` it is *golden brown*

> `continue` spreading the mayo `until` it *covers the bread evenly*

These loops are not looking for some set count. Instead, they will continue to follow their instructions until some condition is met. The computer will toast the bread until it reaches a golden brown color, and then it will go on to the next instruction.

Loops, along with if statements, make up what are called "control structures." Control structures can change the flow of your program in some way. They can optionally skip over some set of instruction, as in if statements. They can repeatedly do some instruction until the computer reaches some set limit, as in a loop.

We have only just scratched the surface of control structures in this introduction. There are various different kinds of loops, different ways to create and combine if statements, and even other control structures we have not even touched on! When you get to class, we will cover each of these in turn, and teach you how to go about using the features of all them. You will learn how to combine and mix all these control structures together to make your programs dynamic and flexible. Soon, all these features and more will be in your arsenal to create whatever kind of application you desire.
